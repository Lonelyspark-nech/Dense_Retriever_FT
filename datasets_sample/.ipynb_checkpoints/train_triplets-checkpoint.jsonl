A living will is a written statement of an individual's wishes regarding medical treatment. The statement is to be followed if the individual is unable to provide instructions at the time medical decisions need to be made. The health care proxy is significantly different from the living will in that it empowers another person (the agent) to make health care decisions if the patient cannot do so herself. The living will, on the other hand, has no such provision but enables a person to express her own choices regarding medical treatment. It makes sense to utilize both a living will and a health care proxy. Do you have to write an advance directive? No. Signing a living will or health care proxy is voluntary. No one can require an individual to complete either directive. Note: The approved New York State Health Care Proxy is available on the Internet in English, Spanish, Chinese and Russian at New York State Department of Health, Consumer Information.

Non-human primates (both apes and monkeys) possess cortical areas that are in similar locations to and have similar cytoarchitecture as Wernicke’s and Broca’s areas in humans, and are probably homologous to them.
